# Multifunctional Dashboard

This project was to create a multi-functional home/office dashboard application. The idea of the project was to create something
similar to the Google Home Hub or Amazon Echo Show. This was done by using QT Timer and Web API's to display the relevent
information. This application provides weather and traffic info based on the users zip-code, 
and displays the time along with a set of rotating pictures.
